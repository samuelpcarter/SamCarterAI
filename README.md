# Rubik's Cube Simulator

The site has been simplified to a single page showing an interactive Rubik's Cube.
Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to play with the cube. Use the scramble and reset
buttons or rotate it with your mouse or keyboard. The cube has been restyled with
larger tiles and a brighter color scheme for improved visibility.
