# Rubik's Cube Simulator

The site has been simplified to a single page showing an interactive Rubik's Cube.
Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to play with the cube. Use the scramble and reset
buttons or rotate it with your mouse or keyboard. Arrow keys rotate the entire cube,
while the U, D, F, B, L, R keys perform face turns. Press `S` to scramble and `X` to
reset. The cube has been restyled with larger tiles and a brighter color scheme for
improved visibility.
